# Maynna's Dotfiles

Public repository for my personal dotfiles.

## What Is This?

This repository serves as my way to help me setup and maintain my Fedora 
Workstation. It takes the effort out of installing everything manually. 
Everything which is needed to install my preffered setup of Fedora is detailed 
in this readme. Feel free to explore, learn and copy parts for your own dotfiles. 
Enjoy and plz *Do not track my dotfiles directly* My dotfiles' repo functions
as a laboratory for my computing environment. I offer no support whatsoever
about tracking it and may introduce breaking changes without prior notice.

## A Fresh Fedora Workstation Setup
