# My linux dev environment

My dotfiles for linux (Fedora Workstation) machine for web development

-   Target platforms: Fedora and CentOS
-   Set-up method: Data-driven, future-proof, scalable and secure tools
-   Vim, running inside tmux, inside gnome-terminal, on Fedora Workstation

## Do not track my dotfiles

My dotfiles' repo functions as a laboratory for my computing
environment.  I offer no support whatsoever about tracking it and may
introduce breaking changes without prior notice (though my dotemacs is
thoroughly documented and I do 100% support all my other projects).
That granted, you can always open an issue here or contribute any fixes.
