"  The <Leader> key is a reference to a specific key defined 
"  by the mapleader variable. The mapleader variable is easy to change, 
"  and if you always remember to map keys with <Leader> then you'll avoid 
"  confusing your own customisation with Vim's default keyboard shortcuts.
let mapleader = ","

" Use different key mappings for easy navigation between splits to save 
" a keystroke. So instead of ctrl-w then j, itâ€™s just ctrl-j:
nnoremap <C-J> <C-W><C-J>
nnoremap <C-K> <C-W><C-K>
nnoremap <C-L> <C-W><C-L>
nnoremap <C-H> <C-W><C-H>
